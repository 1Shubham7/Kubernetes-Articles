## How to Use Kubernetes Annotations?
Annotations are key-value pairs that are used to attach non-identifying metadata to Kubernetes objects. Various tools that are built over Kubernetes use this metadata attached by annotations to perform actions or enhance resource management. Labels and Annotations are used to attach metadata to Kubernetes objects. This makes annotations important for working with Kubernetes clusters. To learn more about Kubernetes cluster and its architecture refer to Kubernetes – Architecture...

## Why Kubernetes? Benefits of using Kubernetes

The popularity of container orchestration technologies specially Kubernetes comes from its use cases and the problems that it solves. Kubernetes is the most popular container orchestration and is widely used by Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), the foundation to which Kubernetes as a project was donated by Google, estimates that about 92% businesses that uses any Container Orchestration tool is using Kubernetes. In this article we are discussing the benefits of Container Orchestration tools especially Kubernetes. We will be discussing the core use cases of Container Orchestration technologies like Scalability, Disaster Recovery, etc. rather than facts like Kubernetes is Open-sourced etc...

## What Is Containerd?
Containerd in simple terms is a container runtime that is, Containerd is a software responsible for running and managing containers on a host system. It is a resource manager which manages the container processes, image, snapshots, container metadata and its dependencies. Going further, Containerd is a daemon for Linux and Windows, that manages the complete container life cycle of its host system from image transfer and storage to container execution and supervision and beyond. So basically Containerd is a complete package for the container lifecycle.

## Benefits and Characteristics of Kubernetes Namespaces
In Kubernetes, Namespaces are used to organize resources. You can have multiple Namespaces in a Cluster And these Namespaces are kind of virtual Clusters of their own. The official definition of Namespace says “In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster”. Within a Kubernetes Namespace, resources must have unique names, but across different Namespaces, you can have resources with the same name...

## Evolution of Virtualization in Cloud Computing

The applications of this day and age are running on cloud, but do you wonder how these applications used to be deployed before the advent of cloud technologies? Containers are the new norm for various companies irrespective of their domain and the work they do, but there has been an evolution from deploying applications in just the hardware itself towards containers and container technologies. Evolution of virtualization brought us from running applications directly in simple hardware systems to the world of virtual machines and containers...

## How To Use Kind To Deploy Kubernetes Clusters?

Kind also referred to as Kubernetes in Docker is a popular open-source tool used for running a Kubernetes cluster locally. Kind uses Docker containers as Cluster Nodes making it substantially faster than its alternatives like Minikube or Docker Desktop which uses a Virtual Machine. Kind is commonly used to test Kubernetes clusters on local machines. Kind is useful specifically when the user wants to create a multi-Node cluster since Minikube or Docker Desktop does not provide any such functionality. In this article we will learn about KinD and see how to use KinD for Deploying Kubernetes clusters...

## How To Share Storage Between Containers In Kubernetes ?

Kubernetes, or K8s, is an open-sourced container orchestration technology that is used to automate the manual processes of deploying, managing, and scaling applications by the help of containers. Kubernetes uses a single container per pod, which is great for most stateless applications, but some applications require more than one container to work together and require some way to persist data and share storage between pods. Sharing storage between containers in a Kubernetes cluster can be achieved with the help of Kubernetes volumes. A volume in Kubernetes is a data-storing feature with the help of which we can store persistent data that can be accessed by containers in a Kubernetes pod. In this article, we will discuss how to share storage between containers in a Kubernetes cluster using volumes...

## How To Deploy Dashboard UI On A Kubernetes Cluster Locally ?

Docker Desktop is easily the most popular containerization software for developers and teams. But Docker Desktop would not only allow you to play with containers but can enable you to use Kubernetes without downloading any external cluster like Minikube. Docker Desktop is a secure, out-of-the-box containerization software that offers developers a robust, hybrid toolkit to build, share, and run applications anywhere. You can also use Docker Desktop to enable Kubernetes in your local machine and you can have a Kubernetes cluster running in your local machine with just a click of a button. In this article, we will discuss how to deploy Dashboard UI on Kubernetes Cluster locally using Docker Desktop...

## How To Create Helm Chart From Scratch?

Helm is a popular Kubernetes native tool for automating the creation, packaging, configuration, and deployment of Kubernetes applications. It is used to combine all the configuration files that are needed for a cluster into a single reusable chart. A Helm chart is like a bundle of YAML files packaged together and made available in a registry so that other people who also use the same kind of deployment can use them in their cluster. In this article, we will see how to create a Helm chart from scratch for a complete React application...
