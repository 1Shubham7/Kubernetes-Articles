Annotations are key-value pairs that are used to attach non-identifying metadata to Kubernetes objects. Various tools that are built over Kubernetes use this metadata attached by annotations to perform actions or enhance resource management. Labels and Annotations are used to attach metadata to Kubernetes objects. This makes annotations important for working with Kubernetes clusters. To learn more about Kubernetes cluster and its architecture refer to Kubernetes – Architecture...

## Kubernetes StatefulSets: Running Stateful Applications in Containers
StatefulSets are Kubernetes components that are used specifically for deploying stateful applications. In Kubernetes on the basis on methods of deploying. There are two types of applications – Stateful applications and stateless applications. Therefore, There are two ways for deploying an application on Kubernetes – through Deployment (for deploying stateless applications) and through StatefulSets (for deploying stateful applications)...

## Kubernetes Minikube
Minikube is a one-node Kubernetes cluster where master processes and work processes both run on one node. According to the official documentation of Minikube, Minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes. A prerequisite to use Minikube is a Docker container or a Virtual Machine environment. Minikube provides you a way to easily deploy application on Kubernetes for learning and developing purposes even if you don’t have enough resources like memory, CPU etc...

## DevOps Best Practices for Kubernetes
DevOps is the hot topic in the market these days. DevOps is a vague term used for wide number of operations, most agreeable defination of DevOps would be that DevOps is an intersection of development and operations. Certain practices need to be followed during the application release process in DevOps for a more streamline workflow, continuous delivery and continuous integration of the code and proper scaling for the application. In this article we will discuss the best DevOps practice you must know as a DevOps engineer/ DevOps enthusiast for Kubernetes in 2023...

## What Is Containerd?
Containerd in simple terms is a container runtime that is, Containerd is a software responsible for running and managing containers on a host system. It is a resource manager which manages the container processes, image, snapshots, container metadata and its dependencies. Going further, Containerd is a daemon for Linux and Windows, that manages the complete container life cycle of its host system from image transfer and storage to container execution and supervision and beyond. So basically Containerd is a complete package for the container lifecycle.

## How to Use Kubernetes Statefulsets?
StatefulSets are API objects in Kubernetes that are used to manage stateful applications. There are two types of applications in Kubernetes, Stateful applications and stateless applications. There are two ways to deploy these applications:
1. Deployment (for stateless applications)
2. StatefulSets (for stateful applications)...

## Benefits and Characteristics of Kubernetes Namespaces
In Kubernetes, Namespaces are used to organize resources. You can have multiple Namespaces in a Cluster And these Namespaces are kind of virtual Clusters of their own. The official definition of Namespace says “In Kubernetes, namespaces provide a mechanism for isolating groups of resources within a single cluster”. Within a Kubernetes Namespace, resources must have unique names, but across different Namespaces, you can have resources with the same name...

## Kubernetes Configuration File – Step by Step Tutorial
Kubernetes Configuration File is the main tool for creating and configuring components in Kubernetes. Components in a Kubernetes cluster can be created in two ways – either by giving commands to the CLI or by creating a configuration file. The advantage of having a Configuration file is that it’s simpler, less confusing, and crucial for automating tasks...

## Fundamental Kubernetes Components and their role in Container Orchestration
Kubernetes or K8s is an open-sourced container orchestration technology that is used for automating the manual processes of deploying, managing and scaling applications by the help of containers. Kubernetes was originally developed by engineers at Google and In 2015, it was donated to CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation)
To understand Kubernetes, one must understand its basic components and its building blocks. In this article, we will be discussing the most fundamental components of Kubernetes as well as what are they used for...
